Hi, thanks for testing Alpha-9.

For more informations about the game, please read "Read me".
For more informations about the new functionnalities, please read "Logs".

So, I added some news features (option menu, achievements).
They maybe weren't that important... but well, they are still useful.
I also added the ability to the ennemi bowman to fire arrow. There are still some glitchs with them, but I'll try to fix that soon.

Please report me every bugs you found or every suggestion you have.
