So back in my last year of high school I had to do an informatic project for a speciality called "ISN".<br/>
I decided to do a video game and thanks to it got 20/20 on the examination.<br/>
When I think about it, it still bring me back good memories, so even if the game isn't that interesting and the code really ugly, I still decided to upload it here.

### Repository organisation
The repository contains the following folders:
- Game: Contains all the game's code
- Other: Some files that were distribuated when I had to send the game to someone
- Report: The written presentation I had to deliver for my school

### What is this game?
I decided to make a RPG, you have to hire some guys and go in an endless dungeon<br/>
The game is a huge mess, some features aren't complete, the game make a lot of references to unfinished content and you can't even win.<br/>
When you'll reach a certain point, your FPS will even heavily drop.

### Downloading the game
The first step will be to download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/).<br/>
Then you'll need to move the "Cartes" folder next to the executable.<br/>
Then just launch the game.

### Controls
Move / Open doors: Directional Arrows<br/>
Speak / Read signs: Enter<br/>
Attack: 1 - 4 (Numeric Pad)<br/>
Objects: 5 - 8 (Numeric Pad)<br/>
Pause: Escape<br/>
Inventory: i<br/>
Show/Hide FPS: Â²<br/>
Show controls: ,<br/>
Turn: A / E

### How can I play?
When launching the game, press the corresponding buttons until you reach the main menu.<br/>
Once in it, speak with some guys and hire them in your team.<br/>
Then you can go in the endless dungeon (left at the buttom left).<br/>
The others stairs are some others levels that aren't finish, you can read more about them in the [full README](https://github.com/Xwilarg/ProjetISNProcessing/blob/master/Other/Read%20me%20please.txt#L55).
